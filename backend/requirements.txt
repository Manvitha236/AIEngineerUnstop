### Monolithic install file
# This references split requirement sets. For quick dev use only base:
#   pip install -r requirements-base.txt
# Add ML stack later:
#   pip install -r requirements-ml.txt
# For everything at once (heavier):
#   pip install -r requirements.txt

-r requirements-base.txt
-r requirements-ml.txt

# Dev / test extras (can be moved to separate requirements-dev.txt later)
